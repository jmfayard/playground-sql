# SQL Playground

This is a playground to practice SQL

## Usage

If you have a JetBrains license, use DataGrip or IntelliJ Ultimate which has superb SQL support

If you are into Visual Studio Code
- install [SQLTools - Database management for VS Code](https://vscode-sqltools.mteixeira.dev/en/home)
- in particular install the SQLite driver

In both cases, create a connection to the local sqlite databse at `library.sqlite`
